              <p>Hello, my name is Callum.</p>

              <p>I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Portsmouth; subject areas that particularly interest me include programming, software engineering and cyber security.</p>
               
               
               <p>Throughout my first year I built on my communication and teamwork skills while leadinging a number of group projects.</p>
              
              
              <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing games, watching football and coding; comfortable in Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Dart, C# and SQL.</p>
            
              <p>You can check out some of my projects and work below, as I learn and improve as a developer.</p>
